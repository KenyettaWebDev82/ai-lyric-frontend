# Nova AI Lyric Generator

Step back into the 80's â€” when music meant holding a cassette tape in your hands, carefully reading the handwritten lyrics on the insert, and feeling the artistry of every word before the song even played. Nova AI brings that vibe into the digital age by letting you generate your own unique song lyrics inspired by mood and genre, then save and explore them like your very own mixtape collection.

This app celebrates the magic of songwriting and nostalgia, blending cutting-edge AI with the warmth of those classic cassette days.

## Code Highlights

### Backend: Gemini AI Prompt Logic
**Backend:** I wrote a custom `generateDynamicPrompt()` function that feeds Gemini a highly specific prompt based on the userâ€™s selected mood and genre. This helped eliminate bland, repetitive AI outputs and created lyrics that actually feel authentic, emotional, and genre-aware. It taught me how powerful good prompt engineering can be in shaping AI responses.

```js
// services/gemini.services.js
function generateDynamicPrompt(mood, genre) {
  return `You're a Grammy-winning songwriter. Write original ${genre} lyrics that capture the feeling of '${mood}'.
Make them feel like a real artistâ€™s song.

Include:
- A vivid, realistic title
- A strong opening with action or imagery
- Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2, Chorus, Bridge (optional), Chorus (final)
- Avoid cliches like 'sunrise' or 'rising from the ashes'
- Use culture-specific references if they match the genre
- Stay true to the mood`
}

async function generateLyricsFromMood(mood, genre, singingMode) {
  const prompt = generateDynamicPrompt(mood, genre);
  const result = await geminiClient.generateText({ prompt });
  return result.text;
}
```
### Frontend: Falling Notes Animation
**Frontend:** I designed animated falling music notes from scratch using pure CSS and mapped them across the screen using JavaScript. This gives the app personality and nostalgia â€” like old-school music visualizers. It also taught me how to create engaging UI without needing external libraries.

```jsx
// App.jsx
<div className="falling-notes">
  {["ðŸŽµ", "ðŸŽ¶", "ðŸŽ·", "ðŸŽ¼", "ðŸŽ¤"].map((icon, i) => (
    <span key={i} className="music-note">{icon}</span>
  ))}
</div>
```

```css
/* App.css */
.falling-notes {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  pointer-events: none;
  overflow: hidden;
  z-index: 0;
}
.music-note {
  position: absolute;
  top: -10%;
  font-size: 50px;
  opacity: 0.6;
  animation: fall linear infinite;
}
@keyframes fall {
  0% { transform: translateY(-10%); opacity: 1; }
  100% { transform: translateY(100vh); opacity: 0; }
}
```
